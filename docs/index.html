    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 01.05.2025</p>
    <p>
        Tex-Air Delivery, Inc. (“we,” “our,” or “us”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect information when you use the Tex-Air Log Submission app (the “App”).
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>The App does not collect or store any personal information on its servers. The information collected by the App includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Uploaded Daily Activity Logs:</strong> Drivers upload their daily activity log sheets as part of their work responsibilities. These files may contain names, dates, and other work-related information provided voluntarily by the user.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use the Information</h2>
    <p>The information uploaded via the App is used solely for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To facilitate the submission of daily activity logs to Tex-Air Delivery, Inc.’s internal systems.</li>
        <li>To generate email notifications to the designated recipient email address configured by Tex-Air Delivery, Inc.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
    <p>
        The App does not store any uploaded data locally or on external servers. Uploaded files are temporarily saved during the submission process and are automatically deleted after successful transmission to the designated recipient email address.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
        The App uses third-party email services to transmit the uploaded log sheets. These services are configured by Tex-Air Delivery, Inc. and comply with industry-standard security practices.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Security</h2>
    <p>
        We prioritize the security of your data and use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect it during the submission process. However, no method of transmission over the internet is entirely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
    </p>

    <h2>6. User Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>As a user of the App, you are responsible for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ensuring that the uploaded files contain only work-related data.</li>
        <li>Using the App in accordance with company policies and this Privacy Policy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. Any updates will be posted within the App or communicated via your company’s internal communication channels.
